    "As previously discussed in our other notebooks, **harnessing agents and tools is an effective approach**. We aim to leverage the capabilities of OpenAI's large language models (LLM), such as GPT-3.5 and its successors, to perform the heavy lifting of reasoning and researching on our behalf.\n",

For instance, we may wish to **enrich an answer with information available on the web**, or **provide users with up-to-date and recent information**, or **finding information on an specific public website**. Regardless of the scenario, we require our engine to base its responses on search results.\n",

      "\n",
      "Wasps can be significant pests, especially during the summer. Here are some steps to help keep them from being a nuisance in your yard:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Identify the Type of Wasp**: Understanding the type of wasp you are dealing with can help you choose the most effective method for removal.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Locate the Nest**: Wasps usually build nests in sheltered areas such as eaves, attics, and trees. Carefully inspect your property to find their nest.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Wear Protective Clothing**: When dealing with wasps, it's essential to wear protective clothing to avoid stings. This includes long sleeves, pants, gloves, and a face mask.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Use Wasp Spray**: Home Depot offers various wasp sprays that can be used to kill wasps on contact. These sprays typically have a long reach, allowing you to treat the nest from a safe distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Apply the Spray at Night**: Wasps are less active at night, making it the best time to apply the spray. Approach the nest slowly and spray thoroughly.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Remove the Nest**: After ensuring that all wasps are dead, you can remove the nest. Use a long stick or a similar tool to knock down the nest and dispose of it in a sealed bag.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Prevent Future Infestations**: To prevent wasps from returning, seal any cracks or crevices around your home, keep food and garbage covered, and consider using wasp traps.\n",
      "\n",
